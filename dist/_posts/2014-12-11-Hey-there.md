Hi!

Vero is off to a healthy start and I'm happy to announce that we've completely sold out of the first batch already! Those of you that got in early won't be disappointed! 

There's not much news to give you at the moment -- everything seems to be going to plan, and OSMC is now in Alpha 1 for Raspberry Pi so we are on track for the software side as well. I thought it would be good to set up this blog to keep everyone in the loop. Although I didn't go with the Kickstarter route, one thing I am quite fond of is how backers become part of the story. As such, I've set up this blog so that I can show (and tease) you with the Vero project and show you as it progresses into a well rounded product. Everyone that has supported this project has helped it succeed and they deserve to follow the story and be kept in the loop.

Thanks, and be sure to check back regularly

Sam
