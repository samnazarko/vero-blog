## Keeping you updated

Hi!

It's been three weeks since I launched the Vero campaign and it's going really well. In fact, we've completely sold out our first batch! As a precaution, I've revised shipping dates for future orders to be early February. It's important I get the current orders out there to make sure I don't end up swamped!

Production is now well underway and we haven't had any problems so far. I travelled last week to see how production was going. Here's the latest:

- The first batch of Vero boxes has been manufactured already. I'm now waiting for a mold to add the OSMC insert on the top of the case
- Remote samples should be coming off the production line soon for final approval to manufacture.
- I'm currently assessing suitable peripherals (such as the power supply unit and SD cards) to make sure they're up to scratch and offer the best experience.

I decided to start this blog as it's the easiest way to keep everyone updated. I wish I had started it sooner but it's been hectic! Although I didn't go with the Kickstarter route, I've always been particularly fond of how Kickstarter projects keep backers updated. **You** have supported the Vero project and helped make it a success, so **you** deserve to be a part of that story. As such, I'll keep you informed on this blog of all the success and any hiccups (hopefully none!)

Thanks, and be sure to check back regularly
