Hello everyone,

I'd like to thank you very much for your patience. Obviously things have taken longer than expected, but that's because I've been making sure that everything is the best it absolutely can be.

The only bad news is that we can't ship in the boxes that we had originally planned (visible in the last post), but many of you didn't really seem to mind.

Everyone who supported the project via getvero.tv will have an account at the [OSMC Store] (osmc.tv/shop/my-account). I recommend you log in and verify that your shipping details are accurate. It's going to take us a couple of weeks to clear the backlog, but the very first orders should be going out next week. 

Of course you'll also get an email with tracking information when your order ships

Thanks

Sam
