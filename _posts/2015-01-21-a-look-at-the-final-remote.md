Hi everyone

Over the next week, I'll be talking about the peripherals shipping with Vero and how they've been cherry picked to ensure the best TV experience! Today's topic: the remote.

The new remote designs are finalised and are well in production now. I hope to have these in their final form within two weeks. 

Here's the final design:

A lot of remotes out there work with Kodi, but they fall short:

* Some buttons don't do what they're meant to do
* Some buttons don't do anything at all
* There are too many buttons, and yet, somehow, it's still not easy to map a button to do a specific task

I made sure when designing the OSMC remote that all of these three problems were addressed. The OSMC remote features a very minimalist design, but every button has a specific
purpose. This remote feels like it's built for Kodi. And yes, there's even a button to bring up the context menu!

Rest assured, this remote is responsive and purpose built!

Be sure to check back in a couple of days for some more progress
