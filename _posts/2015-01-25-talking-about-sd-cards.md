Hi again everyone

One thing that's often neglected is the quality and brand of SD card that is used in people's devices. The SD card's speed can make all the difference on a device such
as Vero which demands heavy read and write speeds for caching and retrieving artwork and other assets.

Consumers have been able to differentiate between 'low end' and 'high end' SD cards by looking at the Class of the SD card. This is typically either 4, 6 or 10 and often gives
an indication of the speed of the SD card.

But, unfortunately, this measurement is not too useful for a device like Vero. Surprisingly to some, a Class 4 SD card may outperform a Class 10 one for the bespoke application
that is running OSMC on Vero. 

The reason for this is at the card numbers are indicative of the maximum sequential write speed of the SD card. This would be useful for say, a camcorder, but not so much
the Vero. 

So what would be useful for Vero? High random 4K read and write speeds are what we're after, as this is what typical OSMC use demands. This is not necessarily correlated to
the SD card's class.

After much testing of several brand name cards (Kingston, Samsung, SanDisk, Transcend, Integral), I have found the best performing card to be a SanDisk. This does happen to
be a Class 10 card, but I did find some Class 6 Samsung cards that came quite close.

SanDisk SD cards are very reliable as well as performant, so I can ship these with the knowledge that 1) Vero users will be getting the best performance possible and
2) They'll keep getting that performance for a long time to come. Just browsing through the OSMC menus with a Class 4 was immediately noticeable when I later compared it
to the Sandisk card.

Thanks, and be sure to check back in a couple of days
