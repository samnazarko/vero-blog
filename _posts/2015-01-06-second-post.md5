Happy New Year!

This week is a long week for me, I'm in my final year of university and I've exams.

Remote samples have now arrived and I'll be assessing them on Friday after my last exam. This involves making sure that:

* The remote codes specified are correct
* The remotes are of the quality I'd expect for Vero
* The finish (colours and logo) look right

Currently, I'm working on finishing the retail packaging and working out the box size and artwork for Vero. I'll let you know what we've come up with when that's finally done and show you an example.

Our skin is progressing well too. There are a few bugs to iron out but it's looking quite good!
